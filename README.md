Exercise

You are the test team lead in a DevOps team setting the right example in working with GIT.

You need to do the following tasks:
• Make a new project environment.
• Configure the environment using your name and email address
• Create an empty git repository in your environment (make it public)
• Connect it to GitHub
• Show how to check if your repository is setup correctly
• Enable SSH access to the environment (and show how to do that)
• Add 2 users (can be dummy users, you can decide) as team members to have access to the 
environment
• Create a document (consider this a testcase dummy document) with some random content
• Add the document to the repository
• Now use one of the logins from eh dummy team members and make some changes to the document
    o Follow step by step how to ensure the version update is managed through GIT
▪ Consider this a real life scenario where you as a teamlead request a team member 
to amend a test case
• Show the way to check if the team member has processed the change correctly
• No the second dummy team member makes a change. 
    o Demonstrate again the complete process
• You are now informed that the second change was actually not needed.
    o Demonstrate how to rollback the second change and go back one version (demonstrate at 
least 2 ways of doing that)
• It is almost unbelievable but the Project Manager comes to you to say that the change was needed 
after all.
• Your dummy user 2 has to do the change again 
• After having it committed, the project manager asks you to merge the 2 versions into one. 
    o Demonstrate how to achieve that
